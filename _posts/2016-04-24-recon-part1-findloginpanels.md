## Reconassiance
In this multipart series, I will be demonstrating and explaining the basics of reconaissance, something that is critical to finding and successfully exploiting boxes. Instead of covering purely technical aspects, I will be covering practical aspects. So rather than focussing on just DNS recon for this part, I will be looking at finding Admin Login portals and panels for sites, something that uses multiple skills to execute successful in most engagements.
