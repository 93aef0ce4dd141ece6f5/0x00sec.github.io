# 0x00sec.github.io
An infosec/computer science community built <i>by</i> whitehats <i>for</i> whitehats.

## Why?

Originally, we all contributed at <a href="http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/">Null Byte</a>. However, upon OTW's departure
from the community
we decided that we needed our own place. The people of Null Byte needed a place uncontrolled by WonderHowTo.

Thus, we aim to create a new place: this place. 0x00sec is the next iteration of Null Byte. Here, contributors will post articles
mainly about information security, but also related things, like computer science.

## We are still under development

We started this with an idea on 4/21/16. unh0lys0da, pry0cc, and I (oaktree, a.k.a oaktree347) set out to make a new home.
We hope that the members of Null Byte can adopt 0x00sec as a new place for the cultivation of new leaders in infosec.

To make this community thrive just like Null-byte did, we need content. We now have a public forum at https://discourse.0x00sec.org/ 
We are looking for inquisitive contributors and question askers, so please stop by and help get this machine rolling. All skill levels are embraced, as this diversity is beneficial for everybody!
